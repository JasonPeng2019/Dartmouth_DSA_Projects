Storing the Huffman Tree:

Go through the original data and calculate the frequency of each character.
Store each character and its frequency as a pair. This could be something like A:5, B:10, C:7, etc., where A, B, and C are characters and 5, 10, and 7 are their respective frequencies.
Sort these pairs in ascending order based on frequency.
Save this sorted list in the compressed file. This list will allow you to reconstruct the Huffman tree when decompressing the file.
Reconstructing the Huffman Tree:

Read the list of character-frequency pairs from the compressed file.
Start building the Huffman tree as you normally would, combining nodes with the lowest frequencies first and working your way up.
Once all nodes are combined, you'll have a complete Huffman tree that can be used for decompression.
