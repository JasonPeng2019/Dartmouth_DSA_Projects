first creates a map with letter: frequency pairing
A:2, B:1

next creates a tree with a node that contains both frequency and letter
null, 3  -> A, 2
	 -> B, 1

take the tree with an empty string.
	- make a new map

	- if it's a leaf, add the 	letter and path to the map

	- returns a map that has the 	path to each letter defined

creates said map

looks up character in map:
finds the path and returns that path as sequences of true/false bits

Extreme cases: 
Singular letter:
Tree has only root.
 Solution: Mark it as a "0". Add char = 0 to the map. When decoding, won't be able to traverse anyways, and will run iterations for each character.
